Registration Form - Java Swing Application

A simple desktop application built using **Java Swing** in **NetBeans IDE**, designed to simulate a student registration form. This GUI app allows users to input personal information and view the data in a dynamic tableâ€”no database connection required!



Features

  - ID
  - Name
  - Gender (Male/Female)

**Data Table Display**
  - View all registered users in a `JTable` in real-time

**Buttons**
  - **Register**: Captures and displays user data in the table
  - **Exit**: Closes the application

**No database needed**
  - All data is managed in-memory (great for learning OOP + GUI basics!)
